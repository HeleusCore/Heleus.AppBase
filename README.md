# Heleus App Base

This repository contains all the shared code and data for our client applications. Our apps are based on [Xamarin.Forms](https://github.com/xamarin/Xamarin.Forms) and run on iOS, Android, Windows, macOS and Linux. Please, do not clone this repository directly, clone HeleusCore https://github.com/HeleusCore/HeleusCore instead. For the development, we use Visual Studio on Windows, Visual Studio for Mac on macOS and MonoDevelop on Linux.

## Prerequists

### Font Awesome

The Heleus apps use Font Awesome Pro. We have a licence for it, but it is not allowed to distribute these fonts files, therefore we can't put them in a public repository. Please have a look at Fonts/fonts.txt for more information.

## Licence

All our apps are licenced under the GNU General Public License v3.0.

The Heleus apps use Font Awesome Pro. It is not allowed to distribute these fonts files, therefore we can't put them on in public repository.

If you have a licence, please put the files

fa-brands-400.ttf
fa-light-300.ttf
fa-regular-400.ttf
fa-solid-900.ttf

into this directory. 

We put some dummy files into fontdummies.zip for the case that you don't have a licence. Extract the content of this file into this folder. Actually, the icons in the apps won't show up. Sorry for that.
